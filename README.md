# UFOs

Overview of the analysis:  
The purpose of this assignment was to provide the end user with additional options to search the UFO sighting database, thus improving the user experience.  Previously, searching was limited to date but now we have increased the options to include City, State/Province, Country, and Shape of the unidentified flying object.    

Results:
In addition to the date field (not shown), we have included an additional 4 search criteria.

Using 1 or more criteria narrows down the results.  As shown below, we can determine how many sightings of a specific shape were reported on a given date, and can further filter it by country, state/province, and even city.

To search, you simply enter your parameters and press enter on your keyboard.  Note that the fields are all lower case, countries and states are referenced by their offical 2 letter code.  The shape field gives a few examples of shapes to search for, howevera more extensive list can be found by browsing the unfiltered data. 

Summary:  
This website allows the user to filter and browse data regarding UFO sightings.  Unfortunately this data is not up to date and is only providing results from a limited database.  A more enlightening and useful feature would b eo scrape the data from the site of origin and provide more up to date information.  Additionally, the search fields require a degree of accuracy when entering search terms.  More flexibility to allow for case type errors and improper abbreviations would greatly improve the user experience.
